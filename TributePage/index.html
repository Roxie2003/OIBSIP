                        <p>Thirty years ago, Linus Torvalds was a 21 year old student at the University of Helsinki when
                            he first released the Linux Kernel. His announcement started, "I'm doing a (free) operating
                            system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional…)".</p>

                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>Linus Torvalds created the Linux kernel and oversees open source development of the widely-used Linux
                    operating system.</p>
                <p>Torvalds was born on 28 December 1969 in Helsinki, Finland. He enrolled at the University of Helsinki
                    in 1988, graduating with a master’s degree in computer science. His M.Sc. thesis was titled Linux: A
                    Portable Operating System.</p>
                <p>An avid computer programmer, Linus authored many gaming applications in his early years. After
                    purchasing a personal computer with an Intel 386 CPU, he began using Minix, an Unix-inspired
                    operating system created by Andrew Tanenbaum for use as a teaching tool. Torvalds started work on a
                    new kernel, later to be named “Linux,” in the fall of 1991 and after forming a team of volunteers to
                    work on this new kernel, released V1.0 in the spring of 1994.</p>
                <p>In 1996, Torvalds accepted an invitation to visit the California headquarters of Transmeta, a
                    start-up company in the first stages of designing an energy saving central processing unit (CPU).
                    Torvalds then accepted a position at Transmeta and moved to California with his family. Along with
                    his work for Transmeta, Torvalds continued to oversee kernel development for Linux.</p>
                <p>In 2003, Torvalds left Transmeta to focus exclusively on the Linux kernel, backed by the Open Source
                    Development Labs (OSDL), a consortium formed by high-tech companies, which included IBM,
                    Hewlett-Packard, Intel, AMD, RedHat, Novell and many others. The purpose of the consortium was to
                    promote Linux development. OSDL merged with The Free Standards Group in January 2007 to become The
                    Linux Foundation. Torvalds remains the ultimate authority on what new code is incorporated into the
                    standard Linux kernel.
